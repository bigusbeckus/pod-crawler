# To-Do

- Cross check batch lookup URL with individual lookups
  > The last time I tried this, I was getting 35 results from a link with 200 ids in it.
  - Check if the podcasts are just dead by making individual calls for the 200 (or however much the batch size is)
  - Check if 35 is the most IDs itunes supports in a single lookup link
